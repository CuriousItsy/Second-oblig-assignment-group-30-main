Create two pages with a shared CSS-file; zip & upload
(( As written in the "Course descriptionLinks to an external site.", this is ALSO a group assignment. And again, we suggest 3–5 as will be expected in the exam. Terribly sorry that this information was missing originally from the assignment description, it should be here as well, for your convenience. ))

First page should imitate* an "Arstechnica.com" article. (Or a similar magazine-like page.) "Imitate" = emulate, copy, take as a model; lay-out — and content if you wish. Not duplicate!

The page you create should begin with a heading, contain a sub-heading and end with the first paragraph after the second sub-heading. Use "Classes" as much as possible. The author should be given an "id" as well, for example 'jtimmer' in this example. 

So, the structure in an article like this is:
title/ main heading
sub-title
journalist name + date
image + photographer
paragraph(s)
sub-heading
paragraph
… and more sub-headings and paragraphs if relevant
You may re-use text from online (add source). However, you may reuse your own text from DATA1100; or you may use dummy-text 
(e.g. "Lorem Ipsum", though meta-data on language for Lorem Ipsum will be wrong, since it is gibberish, not Latin).

Image: Scale it in an editor or find an image that fits. You may use .jpeg (lossy) and use the simplest codeLinks to an external site. <img src="filename.jpg" alt="Description for screen-readers">.
The second page: Data1200 + Accessibility
The second page should have the heading "DATA1200" and have the Learning outcomesLinks to an external site. as three unordered lists with relevant headings. 
This second page must be in a sub-folder. We have touched upon the issues with sub-folders (directories) multiple times. 
The heading "Learning outcomes" should be on Level 2, and the styling of your page should be similar to the one on our official page.

This second page should link to the CSS as well.

Add screenshot of accessibility-test
See below. We ask you to run an automated test. You may want to improve your site and run the test again. Take a screenshot of the (last) test-results and add as an image at the end of the page.

Make sure there are links between the two pages!

All styling (CSS) should be in a single stylesheet saved in a separate directory (sub-folder).

Participants
At the bottom of this second page, in a footer or as a list, add your student email addresses, each and everyone who participated. 
If a student in the Canvas-group is not present here, we may ask it they have contributed.

Accessibility and HTML5
Please run your site on an automated test! For example https://wave.webaim.orgLinks to an external site. [1] or the Chrome-dependent LighthouseLinks to an external site..
